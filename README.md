# MOVIE REVIEWS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Sentiment analysis is a field of study that uses computational methods to analyze and reveal people’s feelings, sentiments, and emotions hidden behind a text or interaction.

### DATA -> PreProcessing -> Logistic Regression Model

We are going to use the Logistic regression ML Model here.
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes.

As it is a supervised learning algorithm, 80% of the pre-processed data is used to train the model and the remaining 20% will be used in testing the model.

## TOOLS REQUIRED

1. **NLTK** (used for natural language ToolKit)
2. **Sci-kit learn** (Python library which will contain logistic regression model)
3. **WordCloud** (A word cloud is a visually prominent presentation of “keywords” that appear frequently in text data.)
4. **Matplotlib** (Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python used for creating high-quality visualization and graphs. It offers various tools to generate diverse plots, facilitating data analysis, exploration, and presentation.)
5. **Numpy** (Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, and it’s specifically designed to help you work with data.)
6. **Pandas** (Pandas is a Python Library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.)
7. **Streamlit** (Streamlit is a promising open-source Python library, which enables developers to build attractive user interfaces in no time.)
